# Image_Caption_Project

Image caption generator is a process of recognizing the context of an image and annotating it with relevant captions using deep learning, and computer vision. It includes the labeling of an image with English keywords with the help of datasets provided during model training. Flicker8k dataset is used to train the CNN model called VGG16. VGG16 is responsible for image feature extraction. These extracted features will be fed to the LSTM model which in turn generates the image caption.

The Flickr_8K dataset is used for the model training of image caption generators. The most important file is Flickr 8k.token which is storing all the image names with the captions respectively. 8091 images are stored inside the Flicker8k_Dataset folder and the text files with captions of images are stored in the Flickr_8k_text folder.
